# Hey there, I'm Seth Aung!

**"Learning to code so my computer fears me too."**

I run **Alinntann Printing & ID Photo** — a small but mighty print shop in Myanmar. I do a bit of everything: photo editing, printing, and now… **diving into development**. I'm learning how to build apps and tools that can help with my work, and maybe even create something cool for others too.

### **What I’m into:**
- Graphic design tips and tricks
- Computer & phone hacks to make work easier
- Learning AutoCAD, AI tools, and everything tech
- Anime, games, movies — yes, I’m that kind of multitasker

---

### **Things I'm learning:**
- Git & GitHub
- Basic web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Python and automation
- AI tools for design and productivity
